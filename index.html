          Water pollution is the contamination of water sources by substances
          which make the water unusable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming,
          and other activities. Pollutants include chemicals, trash, bacteria, and
          parasites. All forms of pollution eventually make their way to water.
          Air pollution settles onto lakes and oceans. Land pollution can seep
          into an underground stream, then to a river, and finally to the ocean.
          Thus, waste dumped in a vacant lot can eventually pollute a water
          supply.

        <h2>Contaminants with an origin in sewage</h2>
        <ul class="myUl">
          <li>
            Various chemical compounds found in personal hygiene and cosmetic
            products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disinfection by-products found in chemically disinfected drinking
            water (whilst these chemicals can be a pollutant in the water
            distribution network, they are fairly volatile and therefore not
            usually found in environmental waters)
          </li>
          <li>
            Hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal
            contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that
            mimic hormones in their action. These can have adverse impacts even at
            very low concentrations on the natural biota and potentially on humans
            if the water is treated and utilized for drinking water.
          </li>
          <li>Insecticides and herbicides, often from agricultural runoff.</li>

      <h1>Types of surface water pollution</h1>
      <p>
        Surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans.
        A subset of surface water pollution is marine pollution which affects
        the oceans. Nutrient pollution refers to contamination by excessive
        inputs of nutrients. <br />
        Globally, about 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation
        as of 2017, according to an estimate by the Joint Monitoring Programme
        for Water Supply and Sanitation. Lack of access to sanitation is
        concerning and often leads to water pollution, e.g. via the practice of
        open defecation: during rain events or floods, the human feces are moved
        from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. Simple
        pit latrines may also get flooded during rain events.

      <h1>What Are the Causes of Water Pollution?</h1>
      <p>
        Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal
        solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other
        liquid on earth. It's the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant blue
        waterfalls. It's also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances
        from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it,
        causing water pollution.

      <h1>What Are the Effects of Water Pollution?</h1>
      <p>
        Deteriorating water quality is damaging the environment, health
        conditions and the global economy. The president of the World Bank,
        David Malpass, warns of the economic impact: "Deteriorating water
        quality is stalling economic growth and exacerbating poverty in many
        countries". The explanation is that, when biological oxygen demand — the
        indicator that measures the organic pollution found in water — exceeds a
        certain threshold, the growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the
        regions within the associated water basins falls by a third. In
        addition, here are some of the other consequences:

      <h1>What Can You Do to Prevent Water Pollution?</h1>
      <p>
        We're all accountable to some degree for today's water pollution
        problem. Fortunately, there are some simple ways you can prevent water
        contamination or at least limit your contribution to it:
      </p>
      <ul class="myUl">
        <li>
          Learn about the unique qualities of water where you live. Where does
          your water come from? Is the wastewater from your home treated? Where
          does stormwater flow to? Is your area in a drought? Start building a
          picture of the situation so you can discover where your actions will
          have the most impact—and see if your neighbors would be interested in
          joining in!
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce your plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you
          can.
        </li>
        <li>
          Properly dispose of chemical cleaners, oils, and nonbiodegradable
          items to keep them from going down the drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain your car so it doesn't leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't flush your old medications! Dispose of them in the trash to
          prevent them from entering local waterways.
        </li>
      </ul>
