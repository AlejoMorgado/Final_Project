        <h1>Basketball</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, lest talk about basketball, but first a little introduction to
          basketball and its history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
          players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete
          with the primary objective of shooting a basketball
          <em>(approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)</em> through the
          defender's hoop
          <em
            >(a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m)
            high to a backboard at each end of the court)</em
          >, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own
          hoop.<br />
          A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the
          three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play
          stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is
          given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most
          points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires
          with the score tied, an additional period of play
          <em>(overtime)</em> is mandated.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical
          education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian
          Association Training School <em>(now Springfield College)</em> in
          Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on
          a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students
          occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England
          winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly
          suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which
          players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by
          tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the
          basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith
          initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant
          that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or
          point scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the
          bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long
          dowel after each scored basket
