        Hi, lest talk about basketball, but first a little introduction to
        basketball and its history.

        Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
        players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with
        the primary objective of shooting a basketball
        <em>(approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)</em> through the
        defender's hoop
        <em>(a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m)
        high to a backboard at each end of the court)</em>, while preventing 
        the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.<br />
        A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the
        three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops
        and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given
        one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points
        at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the
        score tied, an additional period of play <em>(overtime)</em> is
        mandated.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical
        education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian
        Association Training School <em>(now Springfield College)</em> in
        Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a
        rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students
        occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England
        winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly
        suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players
        would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the
        ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic rules and
        nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up
        the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had
        to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored. This
        quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to
        allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored
        basket
